        This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
        be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
        favorites as well!

            Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees) Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste.

            Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
            slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly
            so
            that it does not run off. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
